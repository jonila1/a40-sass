    <h2>Beyonc√©</h2>
    <p  >[Verse 1]
        <br> I were a boy
        <br>   Even just for a day
        <br>   I'd roll out of bed in the morning
        <br>  And throw on what I wanted then go
        <br>  Drink beer with the guys
        <br>  And chase after girls
        <br>  I'd kick it with who I wanted
        <br>  And I'd never get confronted for it
         <br>  'Cause they'd stick up for me
        
        <em>
        <br>
          [Chorus]
    <br>If I were a boy
        <br>  I think I could understand
        <br>  How it feels to love a girl
         <br> I swear I'd be a better man
         <br>  I'd listen to her
         <br>  'Cause I know how it hurts
         <br>  When you lose the one you wanted
        <br>  'Cause he's taken you for granted
        <br>  And everything you had got destroyed</em>
