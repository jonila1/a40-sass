            <p class="lyrics">Fatal, this attraction,
                <br> Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
                <br> But I'm ready if it happens with you
                <br> Meet me out in Cali
                <br> When I'm far away from family
                <br> And I need someone to hold onto

                <br> You're the only thing I know
                <br> And I don't wanna let this go
                <br> Close to you I feelâ€”feel like I'm at home
                <br> Can't wait 'til we're alone

                <br> We were built to last
                <br> We were built like that
                <br> Baby, take my hand
                <br> Dive in this romance
                <br> We could burn and crash
                <br> We could take a chance
                <br> Holdin' nothin' back
                <br> Like it's our last dance
