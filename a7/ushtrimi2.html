        Talk about where we're goin' <br>
        Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts <br>
        Can't get what we want without knowin' <br>
        I've never felt like this before <br>
        I apologize if I'm movin' too far <br>
        Can we just talk? Can we just talk? <br>
        Figure out where we're goin <br>'
